Overall:
1. how sub_team was formed
Team algo ：Cady Liu  ID:110027977 
            Bin zhang(benny)  ID:105046826
            
Team GUI : Julia Sabelli  ID:105048031 
           Ali Saegh  ID:103319692


2. what is each team's main responsibility
Team algo:Basic code writing，include the basic functon and logic，written the fully automatic solution to solve the game



Part1:
This part explains the team algo's job and rough time line.
    1. The algo team will provide the basic functon and logic of the game:
        1. the basic data strucutre will use 3 stacks to represent 3 rod.
        2. disk size will be represented used integer value
        3. follow the logic of the game, larger integer can not sits on top of smaller int on the rob
        4. a 4th rod with cap of 1 will temp hold the moving piece before it is dispersed to proper rod.
        5. a recurive algo following the above rule will be written as the fully automatic solution to solve the game

Part2:
this part explain the team gui's job and time line.
